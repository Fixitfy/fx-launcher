    "In RedM, there is an ongoing issue with the Onesync feature that becomes apparent when the player count reaches 32. In crowded areas, players may encounter visibility problems, making it difficult to see and interact with others. It is recommended for players to avoid densely populated locations to mitigate these issues until developers can resolve the Onesync problem, ensuring a smoother and more enjoyable gaming experience for everyone involved."
